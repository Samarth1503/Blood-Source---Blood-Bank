        <p class="p1">
            Red blood cells make up about half of blood’s volume. They carry oxygen through your body and help remove carbon dioxide! Yes, red blood cells are actually red thanks to the oxygen they transport. <br><br>

            New red blood cells are constantly being produced in the bone marrow. Red blood cells die after about 120 days, but in a healthy person, they're replaced by fresh cells.<br><br>
            
            If a person has too few red blood cells, that’s called anemia. Sometimes changing your diet to add more iron can combat anemia. Other times this condition can be part of a larger disorder.

            Platelets help control bleeding. The main function of a platelet is to interact with clotting proteins to prevent or stop bleeding. When a blood vessel is damaged, platelets collect at the site of the injury and activate substances in plasma which form a clot and allow the wound to heal.<br><br>

            Platelet donors spend a little extra time in the donor chair, but it’s for a good cause. Platelets are transfused frequently for:<br><br>

            Cancer and leukemia patients <br>
            Burn patients <br>
            Transplant recipients <br>
            Heart surgery <br>
            Patients suffering from bleeding disorders <br>
