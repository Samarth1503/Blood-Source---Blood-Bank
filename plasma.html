    <h4 align="center">FRESH FROZEN PLASMA(FFP) STORAGE</h4>
Fresh Frozen Plasma  ( plasma separated from a unit of blood within 6-8 hrs of donation and rapidly frozen) is stored in Bank at -40 degree C or colder .It has a shelf life of one year.  If not stored at this temp the coagulation factors as Factor VIII and Factor V deteriorate and the amount is greatly reduced thereby defeating the purpose for which it is to be administered.
 <br><br><br>
FFP  needs to be  thawed before transfusion. in the blood centre in a plasma thawing bath. at 30 degree C - 37degree C which  takes about 30-45 minutes   FFP is transported in a blood transport box in which the temperature is maintained   between +2 degree C to 6 degree C. Once thawed FFP is infused within 30 minutes.
 <br><br><br>
If not required for immediate use it can be kept at 2 degree C â€“ 6 degree C & transfused within 24 hours.  Once thawed the FFP can not be refrozen & has to be discarded .therefore FFP should be demanded only when essential & in the required quantities.
